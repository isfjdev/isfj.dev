### About

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m isfjdev â€” short for Nguyá»…n Minh NguyÃªn, a software engineer based in Vietnam.

Working remotely full-time, I focus on Go and JavaScript to build reliable and pragmatic software solutions.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a proud father of two â€” a curious 3-year-old boy and a bright 6-year-old girl. They remind me daily of the value of patience, creativity, and continuous learning.

In my downtime, I enjoy traveling, photography, and reading â€” ways I recharge and stay inspired both personally and professionally.
